<h2>Welcome!</h2>

This is my submission for the Code Refactoring Homework/Assignment.

I have made various amendments to this repository including;
  - HTML elements, many have been altered to semantic terms which are more specific to the website content. 
  - HTML sections, which have been separated into 3 parts, a header, a body and a footer.
  - CSS stylesheet, where the code has been consolidated - elimating repeating code and some class attributes which I have replaced with the element name in the HTML
  - Re-organising the CSS stylesheet, ensuring it follows the format of the HTML. 
  - Adding comments to the CSS stylesheet so that it is clear what each command is intending to do. 

My main motivation was to figure out better ways of writing HTML and CSS code to avoid having large, clumpy files. 

This helps to re-organise the code of a web-page and ensure whenever a developer is looking to make variations, it is easy to understand, navigate and amend.

In completing this assignment, I learnt a lot about how to structure my code from the beginning which would make life a lot easier when coming back to edit it. Having the CSS code represented in the same flow as the HTML code makes it a lot easier to pick out issues and provides direction when looking to make amendments.

The below screenshot shows the final product, after the amendments:
